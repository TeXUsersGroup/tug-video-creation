These are the videos that were sent to the mailing list for
the organization of the Conference and to the individual 
chairs that sent it to me.

Special cases are:

Amelia Hugill-Fontanel will not need to be processed, it is
already on YT and we will just link from there:

The "Tactile Mathematics" was given by 5 speakers divided 
in 4 groups. The videos are all here and labelled in order,
but we may have lost nuances from the transfer from one 
group to another that will be available only in YT.

In total, there are 3 talks that have more than one video:

Alexander-Borbon_Inicio_con_LaTeX-I.mkv
Alexander-Borbon_Texto_matematico-II.mkv
Alexander-Borbon_Tablas_en_LaTeX-III.mkv
Alexander-Borbon_Imagenes_en_LaTeX-IV.mkv

Emilio-Kavamura-I.mp4
Emilio-Kavamura-II.mp4

Tactile_Math_Part-I_Al_Maneki.mp4
Tactile_Math_Part-II_Michael.mp4
Tactile_Math_Part-III_Alexei_Rob.mp4
Tactile_Math_Part-IV_Volker.mp4

but we should discuss if they should be joined or not. 
The Workshops in particular have a very nice division
in smaller parts that may be useful to the viewer.

So let's talk ...
